# Security Bot | Anti Grief Documentation

This is Security Bot's official guide on how to properly use Anti Grief.
Its important to note that this system is still a work in progress, and will continue to be updated.
If you find any bugs please contact ry#1000 on Discord.

## Description of Anti Grief
Anti Grief is a system developed for Security Bot to prevent nuking / griefing of your server through 
automated mass commands like; mass ban, mass delete.

## How to use Anti Grief
Anti Grief is a server-owner-only command and can be only controlled by the guild owner.
The only person exempt from punishment from Anti Grief is the server owner.

You'll notice upon setting up the system that you're open to configuring your limits and time.

```
+help antigrief
```

The subcommand limit would be for setting up the threshold. 

```
+antigrief limit <massban/massdelete> <amount>

The threshold in this case would be the limit that has to be passed for the antigrief to work.
For example: 
```
+antigrief limit massdelete 5
```
